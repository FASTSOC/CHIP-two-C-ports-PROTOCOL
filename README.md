FS8626 and FS872, both from FastSoc's FSFC series. While they share many features, they are optimized for different use cases.
FS8626 is more configurable, supports dual-port fast charging with dynamic power allocation, and suits advanced charging systems.
FS872 is simpler, cost-effective, and ideal for applications that don't require complex power management.
